Tower of hanoi

Tower of Hanoi is a classic puzzle game invented by French Mathematician Edouard Lucas in 1883. It consists of 3 rods and different sized disk stacked in canonical order. The aim of the game is to move the entire stack of conical ordered disk from one tower to another tower one step at a time. The minimum number of moves required in order to solve the problem all the depends on the number of disk. If there are 3 disks, then it will require 7 move to complete the game. The size of the problem depends on the total number of disk.

Rules

• Move one disk at a time.
• Only the top most disk can be moved from one tower to another.
• Do not place larger disk on top of smaller disk.
